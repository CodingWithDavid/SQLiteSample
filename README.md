## Why

I have been looking for different database to use for my blogging projects that free or near free.  Thus far they all require some type of license or require security creditials to access.  That always strick me as a lot of overhead just to learn a simple new coding technique.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/SQLiteSample
   cd SQLiteSample
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. Simple application that uses entity framework to access the db
2. Packages needed to run the application

Most of what is needed is the instructions for the database create and the migrations.
